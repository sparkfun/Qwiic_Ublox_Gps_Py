# Example 6
# To set up SPI is as simple as calling spidev and passing the port to the
# UbloxGps library. Other than this the library functions the same. There's no
# need to adjust the SPI settings because they are set behind the scenes
# according to the settings specified in the datasheet. 
#
# Note as of 7/18 the SPI implementation still needs a little work.
