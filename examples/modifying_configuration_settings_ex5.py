# Example 5
# Ublox has changed their method for changing your module's settings. The new
# method requires passing the module the "key id" of the configuration you want
# to modify followed by the value you want to set. If you're requesting
# information then you'd pass the key id without a value. In both cases the
# response will be the configuration data that was set upon success and a NAK
# on a failure. Check the interface description datasheet for more information.
