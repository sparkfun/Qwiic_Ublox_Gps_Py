# Example 4
# This example sets up the serial port and then passes it to the UbloxGPs
# library. Now it's as simple as calling stream_nmea(). The function
# stream_nmea() returns the full NMEA sentence which could be passed to an NMEA
# parser. 

import serial

from qwiic_ublox_gps.ublox_gps import UbloxGps

port = serial.Serial('/dev/serial0', baudrate=38400, timeout=1)
gps = UbloxGps(port)

def run():

    try:
        print("Listening for UBX Messages")
        while True:
            try:
                print(gps.stream_nmea())
            except (ValueError, IOError, AttributeError) as err:
                print(err)

    finally:
        port.close()
